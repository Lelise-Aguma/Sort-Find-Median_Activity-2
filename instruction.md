Objective
    Below is a pseudocode for a more complex algorithm. Your task is to convert it into a working
    program in any programming language of your choice. The program should perform the exact
    function described in the pseudocode.
    Approx 30 mins
FUNCTION sortAndFindMedian(numbers)
 CALL sort(numbers)
 DEFINE n AS length of numbers
 IF n MOD 2 = 0
 RETURN (numbers[n/2 - 1] + numbers[n/2 ) / 2
 ELSE
 RETURN numbers[n/2]
 ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
FUNCTION sort(numbers)
 // Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, etc.)
 // Sort the 'numbers' array in ascending order
 // Pseudocode for the sorting algorithm is not provided; implement as per your
understanding
